# JS Tetris

JS Tetris is a browser-based clone of one of the greatest
puzzle video games of all time. To play you only need to
have javascript enabled in your browser - no plugins are
required (no java, no flush). You are free to put Js Tetris
on your web-site, modify the game. The rules are simple:
move and rotate the blocks with the aim of creating
a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. Use arrows
and spacebar to navigate blocks.


## Download

A browser version of game is available. To run it, extract the
zip file and open tetris.html in your browser. Download it from
