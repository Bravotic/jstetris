# JS Tetris

JS Tetris is a browser based clone of one of the greatest
puzzle video games of all time, created by Czarek Tomczak
(see my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xmoT5Z_zTHkVclqPzrs2aAV64Uiu7fh/view)). To play it,
you only need to have javascript enabled in your browser,
there are no plugins are required (no java, no flush). You
are free to put Js Tetris on your web-site, modify the game.
The rules are simple: move and rotate the blocks with the aim
of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. Use
arrows and spacebar to navigate blocks.


## Download

A browser version of game is available. To run it, extract the
zip file and open tetris.html in your browser. Download it from
the [Releases page](../../releases).
